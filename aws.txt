Concepts
    Each region is an independent set of data centres.

    **Availability zones**: interconnected data centres within the same region isolated from failures. They are connected with low latency network.

    **Hybrid deployment**: mix of cloud and on premises.

    You can achieve high availability by deploying the data/components in two availability zones within the same region

Simple Storage Service (S3)
    Common use cases:
        Backup and archive
        Content and media distribution
        Big data analysis
        Static website hosting
        Disaster recovery
        Data reside in buckets

    Provides REST API with CRUD (create read update delete) operations

    You don’t have to worry about storage limits or capacity planning or durability. Efficient for frequently accessed data.

    Each bucket can hold unlimited objects of up to 5TB and lives in a single region.

    Each object is identified with a key and has metadata associated

    **Concurrency**: Eventual consistency for updated data and read-after-write for new data.

    **Access control**: iam policies, query string auth and s3 bucket policies.

    You can use prefixes for object hierarchy aggregation.

    **Reduce Reduncancy Storage (RRS)**: strategy with cheaper price less redundancy
    **Infrequent Access (IA)**: strategy with les bandwidth.

    You can set lifecycle rules: where data is moved to IA or RRS.

    Supports versioning if objects.

    **MFA delete**: Deleting an object requires an extra token.

    **Cross region replication**: async replicate all objects to another region. Good to reduce latency

    You can set up **logging** of requests.

    **Events notifications** can be sent after events such as upload. Can be sent to an SQS, SNS, or a lambda.

    You can specify world readable, IAM permissions or temporary public URLs that expire.

Amazon Glacier
    Low-cost storage service, good for long term backups and for infrequently used data storage.
    Data is stored in *archives**, each can hold up to 40TB of data and is referenced by an **ID**, not a user-friendly key.
    **Vaults** are containers of archives, you can have up to 1000 vaults. Each vault can have different IAM policies.
    You can also specify lock policies, such as write once read many (WORM).
    You can retrieve 5% of the data for free every month.
    Encryption at rest can not be disabled.

Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)
    Resizable compute capacity. Virtual machines are called **instances**.
    Each instance type has CPU, memory, storage and network performance. There are different instance families (m,t,s...) each scales the price and the property of the family linear. Network performance increases as the family type grows (Up to 10Gbps).
    Families
        Compute optimized (c4)
        Memory optimized (r3)
        Storage optimized (i2)
        GPU-based instances (gs)
    **Amazon machine images (AMIs)**: Is a OS image, usually contains patches and additional apps. Are based on x86 Windows/Linux. Can be:
        Published by AWS
        Marketplace: Customers can provide and sell their AMIs.
        Generated from existing instances: Facilitates reusing instances.
        Uploaded virtual servers: exported from vmware, virtualbox or others.
    Addressing
        DNS: each instance gets a unique domain name
        Public IP
        Elastic IP: reserved IP, not tight to an instance.
    Access is granted through public key authentication.
    **Security groups**: is a virtual firewall that allows you to allow traffic from or to certain ports and IPs. You can associate it with an EC2 instance or a VPC. By default denies everything.
    **User data** is a script you can pass to the instance that runs after startup, to do initialization tasks. It is not encrypted.
    Each instance has metadata associated, it can be found at **http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data**. It includes security groups, instance Id, type amd AMI.
    You can set Tags (key-value) to your instances to easily identify them.
    You can monitor instances using **Cloudwatch**.
    Instances can be resized.
    Pricing
        **On-demand**:  no upfront commitment, fixed price.
        **Reserved instances**: You can save up to 75% if you commit to a certain time. Price will vary depending on the time and if you pay upfront. You can improve specs after purchase.
        **Spot instances**: Customer specified how much he is willing to pay for the instance. If they pricing goes below the requested one, you will get a machine until it goes up again. Cheapest option. Should only be used for workloads tolerant to interruption.
    Tenancy options
        **Shared tenancy**: Default option, same host machine might host instances from different customers.
        **Dedicated instances**: Run on hardware that's dedicated t o a single customer.
        **Dedicated host**: Customer has more granularity and can specify which host to run the instance. It is also fully dedicated for the customer.
    **Placement groups** enable applications to particiapte in low-latency 10Gbps network. The instanc must support it.
    **Instance store**

    Instance types
        **Instance stores**: Ephemeral storage of HDDs or SSDs attached to the host machine. Very cost effective, ideal for temporary storage (caches, buffers). Data is lost if the instance terminates or reboots.

        **Elastic Block Store (EBS)**: Persistent block-level storage to use in EC2. It is automatically replicated in the availability zone. They can be attached to a single instance.
        Types:
            **Magnetic volumes**: lowest performance and lowest cost per GB. From 1GB to 1TB, 100 IOPS on average. Good solution for data accessed infrequently, sequential reads.

        **General purpose SSD**: Strong performance, moderate price. From 1GB to 16TB. 3 IOPS per GB, up to 10K IOPS. I.E 1TB-> 3K IOPS. Good for medium sized DBs, boot volumes and dev envs.

        **Provisioned IOPS SSD**: Highest performance, highest price, from 4GB to 16TB. Well suited for business critical apps with large performance, large DBs workloads.


    **Snapshots** allow you to backup a EBS volume taking a point in time snapshot. Are stored in S3 technology. You pay for the storage cost. Storage in the same region, you will need to copy it if need an instance in different region.

    EBS offers native encryption, through **Key Management System (KMS)** to handle key management. Data is encrypted using AES256. Snapshots from encrypted volumes are automatically encrypted, as volumes created from snapshots.


Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)
    Select ipv4 ranges called inter domain routing (CIDR), creating subnets, route tables, network gateways, and security settings.
    Each VPC belongs to a region. Each VPC is isolated even with the same ip ranges.
    Mandatory components are: Subnets, Route tables, DHCP, ACLs, Security groups

    Optional components: Internet gateway, Elastic ip, Elastic network interface (eni), Endpoints, Peering, Nat gateways, Virtual private gateways (vpg), Customer gateway (cgw), Virtual private networks (vpn),


Subnets
    AWS reserves the first 4 IPs.

    Each subnet exists in a single availability zone.

    Types
        public (traffic redirected to Igw)
        private
        vpn only.



Route tables
    Rules to determine where traffic gets directed


Internet gateway igw
    Vpc component that allows VPC to access the internet. It is a target in your route tables. The EC2 instance also needs a public or EIP address

Elastic IP Addresses (EIP)
    Public IP address you can assign to a VPC or ec2 instance. You can shutdown a machine and maintain the public ip in your account.

Elastic network interfaces (EINs)
    Can be attached to a VPC and is associated to a subnet. Has one public IP and multiple private ones. You can use two EINs to have an instance in two subnetworks.


Endpoints
    Allows you to create a private connection between a VPC and another AWS service, such as S3, without requiring internet access or a NAT instance.

Peering
    Allows connecting two VPCs as if they were the same network. Can be between different accounts but has to be the same region.

Security groups
    Stateful firewall that controls inbound and outbound traffic to AWS resources. All ec2 instances must be launched with a security group. Supports allow rules only. Stateful: Return traffic is automatically allowed. Applies to individual instances attached.

Network access control list (ACLs)
    Stateless firewall attached to VPCs. Set of rules that determines if traffic is allowed in or out a subnet. You are expected to create similar rules as the security grups to defensa in depth. Supports allow and deny rules.Stateless: return traffic must be allowed. Applies to all instances in the VPC.

Network address translation (NAT) instances/gateways
    Allows connecting to the internet instances that are in private subnets. You can use a Nat instance, Eip and Security groups to create instances that can have outbound internet access but no inbound.


Identity and Access Management (IAM)
    Used to control who is authenticated and authorized to access a resource.
    Provides granular permissions and shared access to your account.
    **Identity federation**: You can grant access to users who have already authenticated somewhere else (i.e. corporate network).
    Cloudtrail logs will contains what IAM issues the request
    IAM supports **PCI compliance**
    It's free
    **Principal** is an entity that can make operations on an AWS resource (users, roles, federated users an apps).
    Request contains:
        Actions or operations
        Resource where the action will be performed
        Principal: user performing the action
        Environment data: Ip address, user agent, SSL enabled....
        Resource data: Data about the resource (can be ddb data).

    Authentication
        username and password from console
        access key and secret key from API or CLI
        You might also use **Multi factor authentication (MFA)**
    Authorization
        Most policies are stored in JSON documents.
        Policies define specify the permissions that are allowed or deined for principals.
        **Identity-based**: grant access to users
        **Resource-based**: popular for granting cross account access.
        ACL: todo

Security Token Service (STS)
    TODO

    When you create your AWS account you get a root user
    Users
        Entity that represents a service or person and uses IAM to interact with AWS
        Can use console or API
        has a username/password to sign in
        belongs to a group that has permissions policies attached or by directly attaching it permissions without group

    Groups
        Collection of IAM users
        All have same permissions (easier to manage)
        A group can not be identified as a **Principal** in a **resource based trust policy**

    Roles
        Same as user but has no credentials (username/password)
        It is intended to be assumable by anyone who needs it
        A user can assume a role temporarily for a specific task.
        Can be assigned to a **federated user**

    Temporary credentials

    When to create user instead of a role
        You need a user to interact with the CLI
        When you are the only person using it

    When to create a role instead of a user
        App running in EC2 instance needs to authenticate to interact(assume role, with the policy attached to it. Not auth as user)
        App in phone makes requests to AWS (cognito or federate)
        You want your corporate users to authenticate so they dont have to sign in again (federate into aws)



    Users
        Is identified with afirendly name (shown in aws console)
        **Amazon resource name (ARN)** used to uniquely identify the user across all AWS

    Credentials
        console password
        access keys (key id + secres acess key)
        ssh keys for code commit
        server certificate to authenticate to some services


    AssumeRole
        Used by API operations that access resources from same or other accounts

        API can assume a role to do specific tasks, specifying an ARN

        1. Create policy that allows production app to access ListBucket:
*{
  "Effect": "Allow",
  "Action": [
    "s3:ListBucket",
    "s3:GetBucketLocation"
   ],
  "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::productionapp/*"
},*
        2. Create a role with the previous policy
        3. Switch role CLI (your user needs permissions to assumerole):
        *aws sts assume-role --role-arn "arn:aws:iam::999999999999:role/UpdateApp" --role-session-name "David-ProdUpdate"*
