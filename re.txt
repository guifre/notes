*Reverse engineering*

ASM basic syntax
    Intel-syntax: <instruction> <destination operand> <source operand>
    AT&T syntax: <instruction> <source operand> <destination operand>
    AT&T: Before register names, a percent sign must be written (%) and before numbers a dollar sign ($). Parentheses are used instead of brackets.
    AT&T: A suffix is added to instructions to define the operand size:
        – q — quad (64 bits)
        – l — long (32 bits)
        – w — word (16 bits)
        – b — byte (8 bits)

    mov ebp,esp # moves the value from ESP to EBP
    sub esp,0x8 # substracts 8 from the RSP
    cmp DWORD PTR [ebp-4],0x9 # compares a 4 byte value located in the EBP - 4 with number 9
    jle 8048383 <main+0x1f> # if previous comparsion less or equal to 9 instruction jumps to 0x8048383
    jmp 80483a6 <main+0x32> # unconditional jump to 0x80483a6


General Purpose Registers
    Aimed at doing math operations
    EAX results register (accumulator)
    EBX pointer to data
    ECX counter
    EDX pointer to data
    they can hold 16 bits


Memory pointers
    *ESP* stack pointer register. Points to the memory address where the next stack operation will take place (top of the stack).
    *EBP* stack data pointer. It is a registry used to calculate addresses relative to other addresses
    *ESI* source index
    *EDI* destination index


Control registers
    They control the function of the processor
    EIP, extended instruction pointer next instruction to be executed
    Useful commands
        $ gcc a.c -i a -m32 # compile for 32 bits
        $ gcc a.c -i a -m64 # compile for 64 bits
        $ gcc a.c    -fno-stack-protector # disables stack protection
        $ objdump -d bin # get the ASM of a binary
        $ gdb overflow core # examine core dump
        > info registers # examine EIP, etc
    Compile windows executable in linux:
    *$ apt-get install mingw32;
i586-mingw32msvc-gcc slmail-win-fixed.c -lws2_32 –o s.exe*

    NOP is \0x90 useful for shellcodes to add the padding. Higher chance of guessing the right address

    The stack grows down the address space: as more data is added to the stack, it is added at increasingly lower address value

    4 bytes per char, i.e. array[5] allocates 0x20 = 30 bytes

    The order of the bytes is reversed because IA32 machines are little-endian, reverse the address to use in the payload



The address problem

    Finding the address you have to inject in the payload is tricky, since for every program the address starts in a different position. You can use NOPTs to increase the chance to find a valid address that will end up executing your shellcode


Shellcodes
    Instructions written in assembler translated into hexadecimal opcodes. System calls in linux are  performed using interrupts, as follows:
        1. Specific syscall number is loaded in EAX
        2. the argument to the sys call function in placed into registers
        3. the instruction 0x80 is executed
        4. cpu switches to kernel mode
        5. syscall is executed

    You can specify up to six arguments per syscall (EBX, ECX, ESI, EDI, EPB)

    To check the system calls used by a binary you can use:
        $ gcc –static # prevents gcc from dynamically linking and preserves syscalls.

    Then, we can use $ strace ./bin to see the syscalls used by a binary

    Test the shellcode with

    *char shellcode[] = "\x55"
    "\x48\x89\xe5"
    "\xbf\xe4\x65\x49\x00"
    "\xe8\xd2\x0e\x00\x00i"
    "\x5d"
    "\xc3";
    int main()
    {
        int  *ret;
        ret = (int *) &ret + 2;
        (*ret) = (int)shellcode;
    }*

    You can not put nulls \x00 in a shellcode

    *0000000000401110 <main>:
    401110: 55                   push   %rbp
    401111: 48 89 e5             mov    %rsp,%rbp
    401114: bf e4 65 49 00       mov    $0x4965e4,%edi
    401119: e8 d2 0e 00 00       callq  401ff0 <__libc_system>
    40111e: 5d                   pop    %rbp
    40111f: c3                   retq*

    The middle column is the hex opcodex we want \x55 etc


Format strings
    Format string is a C string null terminated.

    We pass a format argument %s, and the printf function will pop the next element of the stack as a corresponding text pair. If we have not provided one, we will have read an arbitrary stack entry.

    You can use the dollar sign qualifier to acces a specific element of the stack and %x to read the hex memory position, i.e. %4$x (forth element of the stack).
