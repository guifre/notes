*Mobile security*narrative

Threats
    Apps perform network communication, which can occur through unsecure networks such as cafe wifi.
    The phone can be lost or stolen, no app data should be available in the filesystem
    Unofficial markets provide malware threats
    Big attack surface (NFC, bluetooth, camera, SMS, USB, QR, ...)

Common vulnerabilities
    Insecure data storage: data in cleartext, hardcoded keys, or other means that can be reversed engineered.
    Insecure transmission of data: not using TLS or implemented incorrectly
    Lack of binary protections: No having protections against debugging, tampering, reverse engineering.
    Client-side injection: untrusted data in handled in an unsafe manner
    Hard-coded passwords: in the app code or data.
    Leakage of sensitive data: leaking data through OS or frameworks.

IOS Security

    Secure Boot Chain

        The boot loading mechanism works as follows. First, instructions from read only boot room are executed, they bootstrap the system. It contains the public key of apple's ca. Verifies and launches the low level boot loader. The low level boot loader launches a second stage, called iBoot. Then the device boots the kernel or recovery mode.

        ROM -> LLB -> iBoot -> IOS kernel

        ROM is read only data, contains the Apple CA public key and code to load the LLB

        Low level Boot Loader loads the IBoot

        The Iboot loads the kernel


    Secure Enclave

        Co-processor, has its own secure boot and handles crypto, key management, touch ID, etc..

        Does not rely on the kernel. If the device is jailbroken, this coprocessor still works can not be trampered.

    Code Singing

        Signature of apps is verified and have to be signed by Apple CCA. Attacking chain of trust is how jailbreaks work. Best ones attack rom, which can not be patched.


    Process Level SandBoxing

        Unique directories at kernel level are assigned to each process.
        Permissions for microphone, agenda, etc.. must be granted.

    Data at rest Encryption

        The filesystem is encrypted with AES using hardware.

        Individual files can also be encrypted with a key derived from a pass code.

        When the filesystem is wiped, the key is removed and nothing more.


    Exploit Mitigation

        ALSR, apps addresses is randomised at execution time. Shared libraries addresses is randomized at at boot time.

        Write or Execute Memory: writable memory is not executable (xn), executable memory is not writable. Only apps that have been signed with apple own code signing entitlement can have memory with write and execution permissions. This is why safari works better than chrome in IOS.

        Every heap and stack app is not executable by default.

        Mandatory singing of apps.

        Mandatory access control (mac) is apples sandbox. Manages mostly file system access with more flexibility for network, resources, etc...


    File Crypto
        iOS has full disk encryption and additionally offers and api for encrypting directories for apps.


        Per file encryption, each key managed by secure enclabe, uses PBKDF2

    Jailbreak detection
        It is used by apps to detect devices that can run unsigned code, and therefore are less trusted.
        - fork popen, look at exit code. Function calls are prevented by the sandbox.
        - Read a file path outside the sandbox, it should fail if non-jailbroken
        - Run unsigned code, or count loaded shared libraries.

    Bypassing apple apps store review:
        - running rogue JavaScript, serve malicious JavaScript after the app has passed the review.
        - If a bug is found in iOS in the memory layout and app can use dynamic patching to overwrite memory with data not signed by apple and execute it


    Automatic reference counting
        Objective c inserts at compile time reference increase and decrease to know when an object can be freed from memory. But the programmer can still use Malloc free cfretain crrelease

    App file system layout

        App bundle is
        - app name
        - Documents
        - Library
        - - app support
        - - cookies
        - - preferences
        - - Caches
        - - Saved app state
        - Tmp

        Configuration files are stored in plist files that can be xml of binary. Might contain sensitive data. $ plutil -convert changes one format to another

        The applications can share data with other apps by writing to the shared directory

    Security testing

        See all files in Finder:

        defaults write NSGlobalDomain AppleShowAllExtensions -book true
        chflags nohidden ~/Library

        You might wanna use two devices for testing one jailbroken to easily inspect the file system and one without to have all the security features

        The iOS simulator for Xcode does not run iOS it is just a simulator, so it lacks some features such as SMS and cellular camera libraries are slightly different...

        First step to test an iOS app is to run it through a proxy and inspect traffic such as. Burp

        You should install the PortSwigger ca to the preference store to make the mint work

        On an iOS device you can go to settings network proxy and set the config

Analyzing Android Apps

    Android development kit (SDK)

    *$ android avd # create virtual device*
    *$ emulator -adv kitkat # start virtual device*
    *$ adb devices # list devices*

    BusyBox

        App for Android, requires root, linux tools

    Drozer

        Assessment tool, finds known bugs and new ones.

Attacking Android Apps

    Intent: Data object that defines a task to be perfomed

    Activity Graphical interface of app for users

Install app
    adb install diva-beta.apk


Decompile classes
    First get the jar:
    *$ sh dex2jar.sh diva-beta.apk
dex2jar diva-beta.apk -> diva-beta_dex2jar.jar*
    You can use **JD-GUI** to decompile the classes

Getting AndroidManifest.xml and smali code
    *$ java -jar apktool_2.0.3.jar d diva-beta.apk -o output8*

Manual test
    Test the app and check the output of the command:
    *$ adb logcat*
    It will show written files, activities, etc..

Inspecting the system
    You can run the following command to inspect the files created by the app:
    *$ adb shell
    > cd /data/data/*
    Copying files
    *$ adb pull file*
    Reading DBs:
    *$ sqlite3 ids2*
