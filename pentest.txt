    Detailed Summary

Botnet and C&C design
    Clients use TLS port 443 to connect to the C&C for better chances of bypassing firewalls (looks like HTTP and I can use any protocol).
    Certificate is validated client side, to prevent MITM.
    Use multiple valid certificates, each IP range gets a different one to prevent blacklisting.
    I would also have multiple front ends, the client would try to connect to some of them (each client has multiple front end hardcoded).
    The client polls for new commands every  hour, the time can be changed at polling time, the binary updated, IPS and certificates changed.
    Every time connect to a differnet front end to not look suspicious.
    Use TOR hidden services, generate unique domains for every binary.

Ddos countermeasures
    fail2ban (monitors logs and sets iptable rules)
    Use a CDN such as cloudflare, very cost efficient(filters the traffic in the scrubbing centres)
    Or I would spend some money on getting a very good ISP that allows me to put mitigations on their site/
    In **DNS Amplification** an attacker spoofs a DNS query with the victim source's IP. The DNS query is of type transfer or something that will cause a large response. Most ISP should filter spoofed datagrams, some don't
    A DNS server with Open Recursion will respond to any query, not only your authoritative domain
    There are 13 root DNS servers, (IPs) each is a distributed system. Root servers are responsible for delegating TLDs to the appropriate domain. guif.re? root (says .re is foo), foo says ns.guif.re is bar), bar says guif.re is 1.2.3.4
    Bypassing countermeasures
        Find another bug OWASP and hack it down.
        Bypass the reverse proxies and attack the backends.

Avoid detection with nmap
    TCP scan: Send SYN. If SYN/ACK received: open. If RST received: closed. If no packet: filtered.
    Null scan: Send invalid TCP packet, if no packet port is open. If RST it it is closed.
    FIN scan: send fin flag packet if no response port open, if RST port closed.

    -f: fragments packets
    --mtu 24: set the max packet size small to confuse firewalls
    -D ip1,ip2... will make nmap to also send spoof packets with other ips to make difficult to detect you
    –randomize-hosts
    –badsum
    You can find hosts that have no network activity by inspecting ID packets of outgoing packets.If the ID is incremental, you can use it to do a zombie scan.


Open a file as securely
    Check the user permissions to the file and respond correspondingly
    If the user tries a chmod command on the file to escalate his privileges, reject the request
    if the user tries to create a link to the file somewhere else in his directory, reject the request for sensitive files
    If the user is the owner of the file only then allow to edit the file else don't
    Open the file in a mode according to the privileges of the user like read-only, write-only,execute only, keep the default mode for all the files as read-only

1. Planning and preparation
    Identification of contact individuals from both side,
    Opening meeting to confirm the scope, approach, and methodology, and
    Agree to specific test cases and escalation paths.

2. Assessment
    Information Gathering: Using the Internet to find all information about the target, using both technical and nontechnical methods.
    Network Mapping: Identifying all systems and resources within the target network.
    Vulnerability Identification: Activities performed by the assessor to detect vulnerabilities in the target.
    Penetration: Gaining unauthorized access by circumventing the security measures in place and trying to reach as wide a level of access as possible.
    Gaining Access and Privilege Escalation: After successfully exploiting a target system or network, the assessor will try to gain higher level privileges.
    Enumerating Further: Obtaining additional information about processes on the system, with the goal of further exploiting a compromised network or system.
    Compromise Remote Users/Sites: Exploit the trust relationships and communication between remote users and enterprise networks.
    Maintaining Access: Using covert channels, back doors, and rootkits to hide the assessor’s presence on the system or to provide continual access to the compromised system.
    Covering Tracks: Eliminate all signs of compromise by hiding files, clearing logs, defeating integrity checks, and defeating antivirus software.

Terminology
    **Smishing** Phising over SMS. Usually to access financial information
    **Vishing** Phising over phone. Usually to access financial information
    **Side-channel attack** is an attack based on the physical implementation of the system (timing, sounds, etc...).
