*Infrastructure*
CPU
    **Scalar processors** execute one instruction per cycle (Rpi 1).
    **In-order superscalar processor** can ran multiple instructions that have no dependencies at the same time.
    **Out-of-order processor** can re-order instructions that have no dependencies to keep the pipes busy (Pentium 2, modern cortex).
    **branch prediction** is a complex CPU component that predicts which conditional branch will be taken to improve performance. It is a very complex mechanism that is trained at runtime. An attacker can miss-train it to take bad decisions.
    **Speculative execution** will execute instructions that are not needed to keep pipes busy.
    **Caching** uses temporal locality and spatial locality to store data that will likely be used soon.


Terminology
    **Domain Keys Identified Mail (DKIM)** is an email authentication method designed to detect email spoofing. It allows the receiver to check that an email claimed to have come from a specific domain was indeed authorized by the owner of that domain. Uses a signature signed with a private key that can be verified making a TXT dns query
    **Sender Policy Framework (SPF)** is a simple email-validation system designed to detect email spoofing by providing a mechanism to allow receiving mail exchangers to check that incoming mail from a domain comes from a host authorized by that domain's administrators.
    **Syn Cookies** is a technique to prevent SYN DOS attacks, it allows the victim to reconstruct the TCP sequence number or the SYN packet when it recieves a SYN+ACK seq number. This allows the SYN window to be much bigger because it does not have to catch them, so the window is not exasuted
    **Traceroute** works over UDP or ICMP, sends multiple datagrams with different TTLs, every hop should respond with and ICMP error datagram of type 11 (time exceeded).


OSI Model
    Application. Protocols interact with end user.
    Presentation. Presents data in a readable format, does encryption and compression
    Session. Responsible for maintaining connections and sessions.
    Transport. Safety and security of the path taken between the request and response (TCP). Sends segment/datagrams. (seq number).
    Network. Routers. This organizes and routes the data (IP). Sends packets (IP from, IP to).
    Data-Link. Switches ARP. Segments data, encapsulates it and transmits it as packets. Takes care of error correction and flow control. Sends frames (mac from, mac to).
    Physical Layer (RJ45s and physical cables). Sends bits.
    (Please do not throw sausage pizza away)

TCP model:
    Application: FTP, etc
    Transport: TCP or UDP.
    Network: IP (ARP and ICMP). Does routing and packaging
    Physical: Ethernet

TCP Flags
    SYN initiates connection
    ACK acknowledges recieved packet
    RST resets the connection
    FIN finishes the connection


Data types
    Packet: generic term (TCP, UDP, IP...)
    Frame: data link unit
    Datagram: UDP unit
    Segment: TCP unit, can be splitted in fragments


3 way handshake or TCP Handshake:
    SYN
    SYN ACK
    ACK ACK
    (connection established)

    Seq numbers:
        Client **SYN** with **SEQ_N** = A
        Server **SYN ACK** with **ACK_N = A + 1, and the **ACK_N = B**
        Client **ACK** with **SEQ_N = A + 1**, and the **ACK_N = B + 1**

Connection termination/teardown:
    FIN client
    ACK server
    FIN server
    ACK client
    Connection can also be terminated with a 3 way:
        A FIN
        B FIN ACK
        A ACK

TCP protocol

    Error detection
        **seq numbers** used to discards duplicates
        **TCP checksum** to detect errors
        Also, layer 2 adds a CRC

    Flow control
        **Sliding window** each party specifies a **recieve window**, you can only send up to this size before receiving and ACK.

    Congestion control
        Senders will use a **retransmission timeout** based on the round trip time (RTT) of the packets.

    Maximum segment size (MSS) is the largest amount of data to recivied by a single segment


ICMP
    Send error messages and operational information, between not to send data or to be used by apps.

TCP properties
    Connection-oriented
    Data stream
    Packets are ordered, and rearranged to be in-order
    Error Correction
    Flow Control
    Lots of overhead
    High latency
    Used commonly for FTP, SSH, Telnet, HTTP

UDP properties
    Connectionless
    Series of separate datagrams
    Packets are treated as independent. Applications handle ordering
    No Error Correction
    No Flow Control
    No overhead
    Low latency
    Used commonly for DNS, VOIP, P2P filesharing
    Transaction-oriented, suitable for simple query-response protocols    it is stateless,
    no retransmission delays, suitable for real-time applications

16-bit unsigned port number (0-65535)
TCP port range is 0 - 65535. IPv4 (16-bit unsigned). 0 - 1023 are generally reserved for specific purposes

Disks layouts
    RAID 0
        Data evenly splitted accross disks.
        No fault tolerance or redundancy.
        RAID 0 of n drives provide read/write n times quicker.

    RAID 1
        An exact copy in two drives.
        Good read performance.
        Write speed as slow as the slowest disk.

    RAID 2
        bit-level stripping, not used nowadays.

    RAID 3
        byte-level stripping, not used.

    RAID 4
        block-level stripping, not used.

    RAID 5
        block level stripping, parity information distribute among the drives.
        If one drive fails, the others can reconstruct the data based on the parity.

    RAID 5
        block level stripping, doubleparity information distribute among the drives.
        If two drives fail, the others can reconstruct the data based on the parity.
