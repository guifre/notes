*Risk analysis*

Terminology
    **Asset** is valuable resources for the business to protect.
    **Threat** is an action or inaction that could cause harmful occurrence to assets (accidental or deliberate).
    **Threat agents** intentionally exploit vulnerabilities.
    **Threat events** are accidental exploitations of vulnerabilities (fire, earthquake).
    **Impact** is the result of having a vulnerability exploited by a threat.
    **Risk** is the possibility that a threat will exploit a vulnerability to cause harm to an asset.
    **Exposure** is being susceptible to asset loss due to a threat; there is the possibility that a vulnerability can or will be exploited by a threat agent or event.
    **Safeguard/countermeasure** is anything that removes a vulnerability or protects against one or more specific threats.
    **Attack** is the exploitation of a vulnerability by a threat agent.
    **Breach** is the occurrence of a security mechanism being bypassed or thwarted by a threat agent.
    **Vulnerability** is a weakness that allows a threat to cause harm or to gain access to an asset.
    **Exploit** program/script used to exploit a vulnerability and compromise an asset
    **Risk** impact resulting from compromising an asset
    **Risk =Threat * Vulnerability * Impact**
    **Vulnerabiliy assessment** Process of finding all the vulnerabilities
    **Penetration test** exploit all the vulnerabilities
    **Non-repudiation** It means a user cannot deny (repudiate) having performed a transaction. It combines authentication and integrity: non-repudiation authenticates the identity of a user who performs a transaction, and ensures the integrity of that transaction

Risk analysis models
    CIA (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability)
    Disclosure Alteration and Destruction (DAD) is its opposite.

    Identity and Authentication, Authorization, and Accountability
        **Identity and Authentication** Proving an identity claim
        **Authorization** Describes the actions you can perform on a system once you have identified and authenticated.
        **Accountability** holds users accountable for their actions. This is typically done by logging and analyzing audit data.


Security Design Principles
    (My security keeps failing during annual degree exams, lol)
    **Minimize attack surface area**: Remove unnecessary functionality or make it work authenticated users are possible reductions.

    **Separation of duties**: To control fraud; Who requests a computer can not sign having received it; I.e. administrators of a shop should not be users who can buy.

    **Keep security simple**: avoid double negatives and complex architectures when simple and faster approaches work.

    **Fail securely**: If unexpected events occur the application should make sure security can not be bypassed.

    **Defense in depth**:  applies multiple safeguards (also called controls: measures taken to reduce risk) to protect an asset. Any one security     control may fail; by deploying multiple controls, you improve the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of your data.

    **Fix security issues correctly**: Make sure the root cause is identified and the correct fix applied; Similar bugs can be across the company's products.

    **Avoid security by obscurity**: nearly always fails when it is the only control. Do not hardcoded passwords etc..

    **Don't trust services**: If you integrate with third party services you increase your attack surface and your security is as bad as theirs.

    **Security by default**: Enable security controls by default, require strong password but user might change it for an insecure one if they want.

    **Least privilege**: Users should be granted the minimum amount of access (authorization) required to do their jobs, but no more.

    **Use patterns**: Each bug should be fixed introducing a pattern (template approach) so that it does not happen again.

Threat modeling
    Step 1: Decompose the application into use-cases (DFD) of how the application interacts with external entities to understand attack surface.
    Step 2: Determine and rank threats to those DFD, using STRIDE or Attack trees, etc..
    Step 3: Determine countermeasures and mitigation

    DREAD is a classification scheme for quantifying, comparing and prioritizing the amount of risk presented by each evaluated threat. The DREAD acronym is formed from the first letter of each category below.

    DREAD modeling influences the thinking behind setting the risk rating, and is also used directly to sort the risks. The DREAD algorithm, shown below, is used to compute a risk value, which is an average of all five categories.

    Risk_DREAD = (DAMAGE + REPRODUCIBILITY + EXPLOITABILITY + AFFECTED USERS + DISCOVERABILITY) / 5

    To understand the practical risks to a system, you might model threats by considering the following:
        Individual system components: Exploitable vulnerabilities can exist within infrastructure (e.g., hypervisors, software switches, storage nodes, and load balancers), operating systems, server software, client applications, and end users themselves

        Goals of the attacker: Data exposure or modification, Elevation of privilege, Arbitrary code execution
        Denial of service
        Exposed system components (the available attack surface) remote access / physical access
        Economic cost and feasibility of each attack vector

STRIDE
    **Spoofing of user identity** Fixed with authentication.
        For computers IPSec, DNSSEC, SSH host keys, Kerberos authentication, HTTP Digest or Basic authentication, "Windows authentication" (NTLM), PKI systems, such as SSL or TLS with certificates
        For data: Digital signatures, Hashes.
        For people: Something you know (password), something you are (biometrics), something you have (auth key card)
        For maintaining authentication: cookies.
    **Tampering** Fixed with integrity
        For files: ACLs or permissions, Digital signatures, Hashes, Windows Mandatory Integrity Control (MIC) feature, Unix immutable bits
        For network traffic: SSL, SSH, IPSec, Digital signatures
    **Repudiation** Fixed with non-repudiation: Logging, Log analysis tools, Secured log storage, Digital signatures, Secure time stamps, Trusted third parties, Hash trees, and tools for preventing 3rd party frauds (Validation services, Proprietary data/customer history, Multi-merchant data, Purchase device tracing).
    **Information disclosure** Fixed with confidentiality
        For files: ACLs/permissions, Encryption, Appropriate key management
        Network data: Encryption, Appropriate key management
        Protecting communication headers or the fact of communication: Mix networks, Onion routing, Steganography
    **Denial of service** Fixed with availability: ACLs, Filters, Quotas (rate limiting, thresholding, throttling), High-availability design, Extra bandwidth (rate limiting, throttling), Cloud service.
    **Elevation of privilege** Fixed with authorization:  ACLs, Group or role membership, Role based access control, Claims-based access control, Windows privileges (runas), Unix sudo, Chroot, AppArmor or other unix sandboxes,

Mitigating Privacy Threats
    **Minimization** Do not store it, do not send it, dispose the data, do not touch it unless you have to.
    **Cryptography** hashing or encrypting, split keys systems (multiple keys hold by multiple parties to decrypt), blinding (cryptography technique that allows a party to use a service without the service owner knowing about the input or output even if they have the key or are the CA (used for e-voting etc...)

Calculating Annualized Loss Expectancy

    **Annualized Loss Expectancy (ALE)** calculation allows you to determine the
    annual cost of a loss due to a risk. Once calculated, ALE allows you to make
    informed decisions to mitigate the risk.

    **Asset value (AV)** is the value of the asset you are trying to protect. In this
    example, each laptop costs $2500


    The **Exposure Factor (EF)** is the percentage of value an asset lost due to an incident.
    In the case of a stolen laptop with unencrypted PII, the Exposure Factor is
    100%:

    The **Single Loss Expectancy (SLE)** is the cost of a single loss. SLE is the Asset
    Value (AV) times the Exposure Factor (EF). In our case, SLE is $25,000 (Asset
    Value) times 100% (Exposure Factor), or $25,000.

    The **Annual Rate of Occurrence (ARO)** is the number of losses you suffer per year.
    Looking through past events, you discover that you have suffered 11 lost or stolen
    laptops per year on average. Your ARO is 11.

    The **Annualized Loss Expectancy (ALE)** is your yearly cost due to a risk. It is calculated
    by multiplying the Single Loss Expectancy (SLE) times the Annual Rate of
    Occurrence (ARO). In our case, it is $25,000 (SLE) times 11 (ARO), or $275,000.

    The **Total Cost of Ownership (TCO)** is the total cost of a mitigating safeguard.


    **Return on Investment (ROI)** is the amount of money saved by implementing a
    safeguard. If your annual Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) is less than your Annualized
    Loss Expectancy (ALE), you have a positive ROI (and have made a good
    choice). If the TCO is higher than your ALE, you have made a poor choice
