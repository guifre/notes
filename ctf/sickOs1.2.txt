*SickOs 1.2*narrative
    This CTF gives a clear analogy how hacking strategies can be performed on a network to compromise it in a safe environment. This vm is very similar to labs I faced in OSCP. The objective being to compromise the network/machine and gain Administrative/root privileges on them. https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/sickos-11,132/


Level 1.2
    We do a discovery scan with nmap to find the IP addresses
    *# nmap -sP 192.168.252.1/24

Starting Nmap 7.50 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2017-09-21 20:25 BST
Nmap scan report for 192.168.252.134
Host is up (-0.10s latency).
MAC Address: 00:0C:29:CB:55:50 (VMware)*

    Next, we do a service discovery scan.

    *# nmap -sV -A 192.168.252.134

Starting Nmap 7.50 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2017-09-21 20:28 BST

    So again, the attack surface is very limited, we browse the web server. The main page only has an image. We run a directory discovery scan. it find some directories such as:

    */test
    /index.php
    /~sys~ # forbidden*

    Nothing useful, in a response header, the server claims to be running *PHP/5.3.10-1ubuntu3.21*. It seems an old version of PHP, I look for exploits on the Internet and try a few.

    I run out of ideas, set up a ssh bruteforce attack:

    *hydra -l root -P /usr/share/wordlists/metasploit/password.lst 192.168.252.134 ssh*

    I take a look again a the web server, I proxy the browser and open all the discovered direcotries and files, and see how the responses look like in Burp. Found nothing interesting. I run nikito and nmap scripts.

    *nikto -h 192.168.252.134
nmap -Pn -sV -O -pT:22,80 --script *http* 192.168.252.134*

    Nothing useful. I go back to the web server. The best clues so far are the directories found earlier. I monkey with the requests in Burp repeater, until I try an OPTIONS request and boom something useful.

    The obvious next step is try to upload a file with PUT.
